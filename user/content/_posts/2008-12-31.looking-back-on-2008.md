Looking back at all the things that have happened in my life in the last year both online and offline, I am suddenly realizing just how long and adventurous the year has been.

I'm going to take a little time to reflect on everything and give you all a chance to read some older posts if you're up for it.

## My life offline

I started off 2008 in Seoul, South Korea amongst thousands (millions?) of people at probably one of the biggest New Year bashes in the world.  At the time, I was teaching English to advanced Korean students (elementary age) in Bundang, which is a bit outside of Seoul.  I spent the rest of the year there until coming back to the U.S. a few months early in October.

When I came home to Alabama, my sister, Amy, and I decided that it would be beneficial for us both to live together.  So, I packed my bags for Atlanta, Georgia, where I'm currenlty living and working.  At this point, I had decided that I'd be working from home.

Okay, so living in Korea was pretty much the highlight of the year.  I met people from all over the world, learned more about different cultures than many will in a lifetime.  I made many good friends that I will never forget and some that I still keep in regular contact with now.

My only regret is not chronicling more about my life here on the blog, which is something I hope to do more of in the future (even if it does bore some of you).  Here are some posts from this past year on my life:

## My life online

Most of this year, at least here on this blog, has been about WordPress.  WordPress is pretty much my life anyway.  The highlight of the year online for me was launcing <a href="http://themehybrid.com" title="Theme Hybrid: WordPress themes club">Theme Hybrid</a>.  Since I blogged so much about WordPress, I'll have to break these posts into categories.

## Looking toward 2009

I suppose it's time to say farewell to 2008.  It's been a great year, and I expect 2009 to be even better.

Now I'm off to draft my goals for the new year.  There's a lot to look forward to.  I hope everyone has a safe and happy New Year's Eve.
