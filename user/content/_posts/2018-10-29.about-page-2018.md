A bit over [5 years ago](/archives/2013/02/11/about-page-update) I made a promise to not make the updating of my [about page](/about) a quinquennial event.  I didn't quite live up to that promise.

Time passes by quickly.  It's hard to believe it's been 5 years.

I wasn't much in the mood to create a new about page today.  However, I had "Update About Page" listed as my most important task on the schedule.  Because I've been attempting to stay on track and always complete the tasks I've assigned myself every day, I had no choice but to muddle through.

Therefore, the new and improved (?) about page is essentially a brain dump.  I will definitely, absolutely, assuredly update it within the next half decade.
