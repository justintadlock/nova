I did a quick [interview on Web hosting](https://ithemes.com/2018/12/17/hosting-insights-justin-tadlock/) with iThemes.  Hosting isn't an area I'm particularly interested in, but it's all a part of the process.  I tend to think in terms of having ready-made solutions that aren't a lot of work when it comes to the average user.
