10 years.

Ten years of blogging.

Generally, April 15 is my least favorite day of the year (tax day in the U.S.).  But, this year, I'm celebrating 10 years of running a Web site.

Ten years ago today, I stepped down a path that has changed my life in more ways than I can count.  The site started out as a page on now-defunct Expage.com.  I'd made a simple page with shoutouts to all my old high school friends.  Little did I know that I'd eventually be earning my income from something that started out with so little substance.  This blog has been with me since I was a confused teenager and continues to be an outlet for me as a somewhat less-confused adult.

I won't bore you with all the details.  You can check out the <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives" title="Archives">archives</a> if you want to see my journey.  You can even start with my <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2003/04/15/welcome-to-my-site" title="Welcome to my site">first blog post</a>.

I want to thank everyone who has taken this journey with me.  In particular, I want to thank everyone involved in the WordPress community for giving me a platform that has allowed me to easily publish my content online for the better part of these past 10 years (it sure beats the heck out of those text files I started with).

I'm looking forward to the next 10.  I hope they're as exciting as the previous years and that you will continue reading and commenting.

I'll leave you with some of the most popular items from my blog over the years.

## Top 10 commented posts

Here's a rundown of the most popular posts on my blog by comment count.  Note that some of the themes are pretty high up there because I didn't have a support forum back in the day.

## Top 10 Google Analytics posts

I've only been using Google Analytics since late 2007 and routinely removed the tracking code from my site every time I changed themes (yes, tracking codes belong in plugins), so these numbers aren't entirely accurate.  However, they will give you a good view of my most visited posts on this site thus far.
