I'm running a special over at <a href="http://themehybrid.com" title="Theme Hybrid: A WordPress themes club that doesn't break the bank">Theme Hybrid</a> that allows people to sign up for the exclusive membership for only $10.

<a href="http://themehybrid.com/theme-club" title="Theme Hybrid themes club memberships at $10"><img src="http://justintadlock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/10-dollar-theme-club.png" alt="Join the theme club for $10" title="10 Dollar WordPress Themes Club" class="center aligncenter size-full wp-image-1075" /></a>

I figured it was about time to start growing the community there a bit more.  I have a lot of ideas in the pipeline, and this is an opportune time to sign up if you've been thinking about it.

You can read the <a href="http://themehybrid.com/archives/2008/10/15-theme-club-discount" title="$15 discount on theme club memberships">announcement post</a> for full details.

This offer is available for the first 100 users to sign up for the exclusive membership.

## What you'll receive

By signing up, you'll get a year's worth of cool WordPress child themes that extend the freely available base themes with a full support system in place.  Plus, I have a few other things in the works for exclusive members.

Well, that's pretty much the gist of it.  It doesn't get much simpler than that.  Quality themes.  Quality service.  A price tag that won't break the bank.
