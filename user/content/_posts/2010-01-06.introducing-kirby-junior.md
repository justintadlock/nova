I've stuck with the same design for just over a year here on this blog, which is the longest I've ever kept a single design.

And, to be honest, I haven't been too motivated in updating it.

But, that all changed when I saw the first version of Ian Stewart's <em>Kirby</em> theme posted via Twitter.

I liked the clean design and the large, yet elegant, typography.  It at least motivated me enough to start using the design from the <em>Kirby</em> theme here on my blog.

I don't mind using other people's designs, but it's tough for me to use other code.  Pretty much anything I do has to run on top of the <a href="http://themehybrid.com/themes/hybrid" title="Hybrid WordPress theme"><em>Hybrid</em> theme</a>.  So, I set out to make <em>Kirby</em> a child theme of <em>Hybrid</em>.

I'm now using the <em>Kirby Junior</em> child theme on this site.

## A new default WordPress theme

The point of this post isn't to talk about how I'm using the theme on this site, but to make note that I'd love for <em>Kirby</em> to be the new default WordPress theme.  On the ThemeShaper blog, Ian has a fairly lengthy <a href="http://themeshaper.com/new-default-theme-wordpress-kirby/" title="An Idea for a New Default Theme for WordPress &mdash; Introducing Kirby">post on why it should be the default theme</a>.

I've never liked <em>Kubrick</em> (current default theme) enough to run on my blog.  <em>Kirby</em> is a theme that I'd actually use on my personal blog, which is something I don't say often about other people's themes.

## My notes on the <em>Kirby</em> theme

While I am using just the design here on my blog, I did spend some time sifting through the theme code.  Overall, it's solid.  These are some of my notes on version 0.3 of the <em>Kirby</em> theme.  Let's hope Ian can make use of these.

<ul>
	<li>Integrate post images/thumbnails.  So many people use some sort of thumbnail setup these days, that it may as well be added.</li>
	<li>Add a default <code>taxonomy.php</code> file to handle custom taxonomies.</li>
	<li>A <code>searchform.php</code> file is needed for users that add a search form to their site.</li>
	<li>I'm not a fan of the several <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statements in the header for the <code>&lt;title></code> element. These could less-messily be done from the theme's functions file.</li>
	<li>The comment reply script should be added through <code>functions.php</code> and only active if a user is using threaded comments.</li>
	<li>Users shouldn't be required to use a custom field to turn on comments for pages.  There's an admin option for this on the page editor screen.</li>
	<li>Template code cleanup.  I'd like to see a better indentation system in place to help users understand what's happening.</li>
</ul>

These are my personal ideas for the theme.  Feel free to disagree.  And, please offer your suggestions and thoughts on the  <a href="http://themeshaper.com/new-default-theme-wordpress-kirby/" title="An Idea for a New Default Theme for WordPress &mdash; Introducing Kirby"><em>Kirby</em> theme post</a>.

Or, if you have alternate ideas for what the default WordPress theme should be, share your opinion.

<p class="note">Please note that the design you see here on my site isn't a completely accurate representation of the <em>Kirby</em> theme.  The version I'm using has several modifications.  I highly suggest checking out the actual theme to get a feel for how it works.</p>
