WordPress supports very little in the way of post relationships.  The only one it supports out of the box is a one-to-one relationship from parent-to-child.  One of the questions that I see once in a while is how to make a post from one post type a child of a post from another post type.

A user on my support forums at [Theme Hybrid](http://themehybrid.com) had an interesting project he was building.  Here's an extremely general outlook at his setup.

* "Neighborhood" custom post type.
* "Place" post type for individual places within a neighborhood.
* Both post types are flat (non-hierarchical).
* Each place needed to be assigned to a specific neighborhood.

Because this was an interesting project with such a simple solution, I thought I'd share it with everyone.

## How to assign a parent post

I'm going to assume you're advanced enough to know how to build a plugin as well as understand the inner-workings of post types.  If not, I recommend reading my [tutorial on post types](/archives/2010/04/29/custom-post-types-in-wordpress) for WordPress.

For this project, you'll need two non-hierarchical post types named `neighborhood` and `place`.  Now, for the fun part.  All you need to do is add the following code to your plugin's admin files.

```
/* Hook meta box to just the 'place' post type. */
add_action( 'add_meta_boxes_place', 'my_add_meta_boxes' );

/* Creates the meta box. */
function my_add_meta_boxes( $post ) {

	add_meta_box(
		'my-place-parent',
		__( 'Neighborhood', 'example-textdomain' ),
		'my_place_parent_meta_box',
		$post->post_type,
		'side',
		'core'
	);
}

/* Displays the meta box. */
function my_place_parent_meta_box( $post ) {

	$parents = get_posts(
		array(
			'post_type'   => 'neighborhood',
			'orderby'     => 'title',
			'order'       => 'ASC',
			'numberposts' => -1
		)
	);

	if ( !empty( $parents ) ) {

		echo '<select name="parent_id" class="widefat">'; // !Important! Don't change the 'parent_id' name attribute.

		foreach ( $parents as $parent ) {
			printf( '<option value="%s"%s>%s</option>', esc_attr( $parent->ID ), selected( $parent->ID, $post->post_parent, false ), esc_html( $parent->post_title ) );
		}

		echo '</select>';
	}
}
```

That's all there is to it.  You will, of course, want to alter the post type names to reference your own post types.

Here's a quick screenshot of the admin after applying the above code.

## The hard part

So, the next question becomes, "How do I set up a hierarchical permalink structure for this?"  I'd rather have hot pokers thrust into my eyeballs than try to explain the WordPress rewrite API.  Ozh did a heck of a job writing that chapter in our [Plugin Dev Book](/plugindevbook) if you're interested in diving into that sort of thing.

A lot of that depends on your custom setup anyway, so I'll leave that tutorial for another day.

## Other post relationships

Sure, this is cool, but it's also limited.  With your thinking cap on and post meta, you can do some pretty neat stuff outside of parent-to-child relationships.  It's not that tough for simple stuff, but for more complex relationships, you'll need to look at other solutions.

Post relationships are [potentially on the roadmap](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/07/28/potential-roadmap-for-taxonomy-meta-and-post-relationships/), but don't count on that being available soon.  Until then, I highly recommend the [Posts 2 Posts plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/posts-to-posts/).
