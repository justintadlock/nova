To continue working on my <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2009/02/06/on-a-mission-to-create-new-wordpress-widgets" title="On a mission to create new WordPress widgets">mission to create new WordPress widgets</a>, fulfill my obsession with <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2009/03/24/template-tag-shortcodes-wordpress-plugin" title="Template Tag Shortcodes: WordPress Plugin">shortcodes</a>, and release my fourth plugin this month, I present to you <em>Quote This</em>, a plugin to display quotes on your blog.

I didn't set out to <em>break the mold</em> with this plugin.  I'm well aware of several other plugins that display quotes, some which probably do it far better than this plugin does.

I've been using this on my blog for several years now, and I figured I might as well turn it into a plugin.  I actually mentioned creating it in a <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/03/17/the-options-themes-new-groove#comment-3541" title="Comment 3541">comment</a> just over a year ago.  So, it's been lying around, gathering dust.

You can see it in action on my <a href="http://justintadlock.com/writing" title="Writing">Writing page</a>.

## What does the Quote This plugin do?

It is my personal collection of quotes that can be randomly displayed on your blog.  There are three ways to use it:

<ul>
	<li>Call the <code>quote_this()</code> function in your theme template files.</li>
	<li>Type the <code>&#091;quote-this&#093;</code> shortcode in your posts and pages.</li>
	<li>Use the <em>Quote This</em> widget in your widget areas.</li>
</ul>

You can display quotes from several categories:

<ul>
	<li>Art</li>
	<li>Film</li>
	<li>Friendship</li>
	<li>Individual</li>
	<li>Life</li>
	<li>Literature</li>
</ul>

## Future features of the Quote This plugin

Right now, the plugin is nothing special.  It doesn't have a ton of quotes or 100 features to choose from.  It's just a simple plugin.

I'd like to add in more formatting options.  Maybe even throw in an option to grab quotes by author.  Add in various ways to display quotes.  I'm open to suggestions.

The main thing is to add more quotes to the <em>Quote This</em> collection.  I'll probably periodically update it with new quotes when I'm bored (I like to collect quotes).  Of course, you all are welcome to submit quotes as well.  Just send me an <a href="http://justintadlock.com/contact" title="Justin Tadlock's contact page">email</a> if you'd like with the quotes (include quote authors).  I'll be happy to add them to the plugin.
